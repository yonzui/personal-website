### about melo(n)
this is a suuuuuuuper laid back personal website i made (if u can even call it that LOL). i got a lot of my inspo from different sites on neocities, and used html, css, and java in vscode in order to develop this website. this site has some of my niche interests, as well as information about me and my life. the inspiration for this site's name came from some of my favorite fruits: watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew!

i had a lot of fun making this, and this is my first ever big project related to computer science. i made this mainly to submit to hack club's athena award, as well as to get more complex practice with html, css, and js.

### keep in mind...
1. this is meant to be viewed on desktop only! i'm very very new at coding, so there's definitely messy spots in my code that i should clean up later.
2. that being said, this site is still under construction! i have everything that i mainly want to get on there, but i have a lot of visions for the future.

### challenges
since i'm so new at coding, i ended up having to do a lot of commits thru github so that the site would function properly. i kept getting error messages and i was about to lose my mind but i powered through (barely). i also had suuuuuuuuch a hard time with the column layout on the site. i think it took me like 3 hours just to get everything laid out. i'm much better at html+css, and i still have a lot to learn about js. i tried to implement a music player but there are still some issues with it that i want to go in and fix later.

### outcomes
i learned so much more on how to clean up my code, mainly my css. there were a lot of methods i used in order to revise my code and keep it concise. also, i learned that i need to be much more patient with myself while coding. there were a lot of times i'd try to do a bunch of coding at once, but that caused me to burn out quicker.
