### about mel(o)n
this is a suuuuuuuper laid back personal website i made (if u can even call it that LOL). i got a lot of my inspo from different sites on neocities, and used html+css+js in vscode in order to develop this website. i had a lot of fun making this, and this is my first ever big project related to computer science. this is also my main project for hack club's athena award!
### keep in mind...
1. this is meant to be viewed on desktop only! i'm very very new at coding, so there's definitely messy spots in my code that i should clean up later.
2. that being said, this site is still under construction! i have everything that i mainly want to get on there, but i have a lot of visions for the future.
### challenges
since i'm so new at coding, i ended up having to do a lot of commits thru github so that the site would function properly. i kept getting error messages and i was about to lose my mind but i powered through (barely). i also had suuuuuuuuch a hard time with the column layout on the site. i think it took me like 3 hours just to get everything laid out. i'm much better at html+css, and i still have a lot to learn about js. i tried to implement a music player but there are still some issues with it that i want to go in and fix later.
